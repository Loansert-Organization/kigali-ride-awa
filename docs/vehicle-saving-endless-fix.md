# Vehicle Saving Endless Fix

## Problem
The "Saving Vehicle..." message was showing endlessly when trying to save vehicle information.

## Root Cause
Variable name shadowing in the `handleSave` function:
```javascript
const vehicle = { ...vehicle, ... }; // This creates a circular reference
```

The local `vehicle` variable was shadowing the component state `vehicle`, causing issues.

## Solution

1. **Renamed the local variable** from `vehicle` to `vehicleData`
2. **Added proper error handling** with try/catch/finally
3. **Fixed the API call** - removed unnecessary JSON.stringify
4. **Added validation** for empty license plate
5. **Improved navigation** to `/driver/home` (correct route)
6. **Added detailed logging** for debugging

## Key Changes

```javascript
// Before (problematic)
const vehicle = { ...vehicle, driver_id: user?.id };
body: JSON.stringify(vehicle)

// After (fixed)
const vehicleData = { ...vehicle, driver_id: user?.id };
body: vehicleData
```

## User Experience

1. Enter vehicle type and license plate
2. Click "Save Vehicle"
3. See success toast message
4. Automatically navigate to driver home after 1 second
5. If offline, saves locally with appropriate message

## Testing

1. Open browser console to see debug logs
2. Enter license plate
3. Click save
4. Should see:
   - "Saving Vehicle..." briefly
   - Success toast
   - Navigation to driver home

## Edge Cases Handled

- Empty license plate validation
- Offline mode (saves locally)
- Local sessions (no database calls)
- Network errors (graceful fallback)
- Unexpected errors (proper cleanup)
